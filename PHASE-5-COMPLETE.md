## üí° Implementation Notes

### Design Decisions

#### 1. Real-time Data
‚úÖ **Why**: Better user experience, accurate information
‚ùå **Alternative**: Cached data (considered but rejected for accuracy)

#### 2. Permission Gates
‚úÖ **Why**: Security first, granular control
‚ùå **Alternative**: Role-based only (less flexible)

#### 3. Separate Profile Page
‚úÖ **Why**: Dedicated space for personal settings
‚ùå **Alternative**: Profile in Settings (too crowded)

#### 4. Audit Log Export
‚úÖ **Why**: Compliance requirements, offline analysis
‚ùå **Alternative**: API only (less user-friendly)

### Performance Optimizations
- Lazy loading of large lists
- Debounced search
- Cached permission checks
- Optimistic UI updates
- Efficient database queries

---

## üöß What's Not Included

### Dark Mode Support (Optional - Not Started)
**Why skipped**: 
- Time constraint
- Low priority for MVP
- Requires theme system setup

**Estimated time**: 3-4 hours
**Implementation steps**:
1. Set up theme context
2. Update Tailwind config
3. Add dark mode variants
4. Create theme toggle
5. Persist preference

### User Avatar Upload (Future Enhancement)
**Why skipped**:
- Requires file storage setup
- External service integration
- Image processing

**Estimated time**: 4-6 hours

### Advanced Filtering (Future Enhancement)
- Date range picker
- Multiple resource selection
- Action type filter
- User filter

**Estimated time**: 2-3 hours

- Users List: ~900ms

### Database Queries
- Dashboard: 4 queries
